# Face Detection and Distance Estimation

## Description
This project uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using a webcam. It estimates the distance to the detected face based on the height of the face in pixels and known average face height.

## Features
- Real-time face detection with Haar Cascade.
- Distance estimation displayed on the video feed.
- Simple exit instructions (press 'q' to quit).
- Adjustable focal length for accuracy.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
Run the program `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb python3 face_detection.py`
